# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

We are committed to making participation in this project a welcoming, respectful, and harassment-free experience for
everyone, regardless of age, background, disability, ethnicity, gender identity or expression, level of experience,
language, national origin, personal beliefs, race, religion, sexual orientation, or socioeconomic status.

## Our Standards

We strive to:

1. **Be open.** We invite anyone to participate. We prefer public communication for project-related discussions so that
   everyone can benefit and contribute.

2. **Be empathetic, welcoming, and patient.** We work together to resolve conflicts, assume good intentions, and act
   with empathy. Frustration is natural, but it must never turn into a personal attack. A community where people feel
   uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.

3. **Be collaborative.** Others will use our work, and we depend on the work of others. We explain our decisions and our
   code so others can build on it. We consider the impact of our choices on users and fellow contributors.

4. **Be inquisitive.** Nobody knows everything. Asking questions early prevents problems later. Those who receive
   questions should be responsive and helpful.

5. **Be careful in the words we choose.** We value professionalism and take responsibility for our own speech. Be kind.
   Do not insult or demean others. Harassment and exclusionary behavior are not acceptable, including but not limited
   to:
    - Violent threats or language directed against another person
    - Discriminatory jokes and language
    - Posting sexually explicit or violent material
    - Posting or threatening to post others' personally identifying information ("doxing")
    - Sharing private communications without consent
    - Personal insults
    - Unwelcome sexual attention
    - Repeated harassment -- if someone asks you to stop, then stop
    - Advocating for or encouraging any of the above behavior

6. **Be concise.** Respect others' time. Write clearly so conversations stay productive. When a long explanation is
   necessary, consider including a summary. Stay on topic, especially in lengthy discussions.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it by opening a private communication with the project
maintainers. You can
use [GitHub's private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/grails-plugins/grails-server-timing/security/advisories/new)
or contact the maintainers directly.

When reporting, assume good faith - it is more likely that someone is unaware of the impact of their behavior than that
they are intentionally causing harm.

## Enforcement

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing these standards. In response to behavior that violates
this code, maintainers may take any action they deem appropriate, including a temporary or permanent ban from the
project.
