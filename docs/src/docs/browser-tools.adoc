== Using Browser Developer Tools

One of the primary benefits of the Server Timing header is that modern browsers automatically display this information in their developer tools.

=== Viewing Server Timing in Chrome

1. Open Chrome Developer Tools (F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I / Cmd+Option+I)
2. Navigate to the **Network** tab
3. Make a request to your Grails application
4. Click on the request in the list
5. Select the **Timing** tab in the details panel

You'll see a breakdown of the request timing, including the custom metrics from this plugin displayed under "Server Timing".

=== Viewing Server Timing in Firefox

1. Open Firefox Developer Tools (F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I / Cmd+Option+I)
2. Navigate to the **Network** tab
3. Make a request to your Grails application
4. Click on the request in the list
5. Select the **Timings** tab in the details panel

The Server Timing metrics appear at the bottom of the timing breakdown.

=== Viewing Server Timing in Safari

1. Open Safari Web Inspector (Cmd+Option+I)
2. Navigate to the **Network** tab
3. Make a request to your Grails application
4. Click on the request in the list
5. Look for the Server Timing section in the timing details

=== Understanding the Metrics

When viewing the Server Timing data for a Grails controller request, you'll typically see:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Metric | Description

| `total`
| The complete request processing time from when the filter receives the request until the response is committed.

| `action`
| Time spent executing your controller action code. This includes any service calls, database queries, or other logic in your action method.

| `view`
| Time spent rendering the GSP view or other response template. This starts after your action returns and ends when the view is fully rendered.

| `other`
| For non-controller requests (like static assets), this captures the processing time. For controller requests, this metric is stopped when the action begins.

=== Example Header Value

A typical `Server-Timing` header from a Grails controller request looks like:

[source,http]
----
Server-Timing: total;dur=156.3;desc="Total",action;dur=45.2;desc="Action",view;dur=98.7;desc="View"
----

This tells you:

* Total request time: 156.3ms
* Controller action execution: 45.2ms
* View rendering: 98.7ms

=== Interpreting Results

==== Slow Action Time

If `action` timing is high, investigate:

* Database queries
* External API calls
* Complex business logic
* Service method performance

==== Slow View Time

If `view` timing is high, investigate:

* Complex GSP logic or loops
* Many template includes
* Large data sets being rendered
* Inefficient tag library usage

=== Programmatic Client Side Access

You can access Server Timing data programmatically in JavaScript using the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceServerTiming[Performance API^]:

[source,javascript]
----
const entries = performance.getEntriesByType('navigation');
entries.forEach(entry => {
    if (entry.serverTiming) {
        entry.serverTiming.forEach(timing => {
            console.log(`${timing.name}: ${timing.duration}ms`);
        });
    }
});
----
