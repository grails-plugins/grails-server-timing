== Introduction

The Grails Server Timing plugin adds https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Server-Timing[Server-Timing^] HTTP headers to your Grails application responses.
This allows you to see detailed server-side performance metrics directly in your browser's developer tools.

=== What is Server-Timing?

The `Server-Timing` header is part of the https://www.w3.org/TR/server-timing/[W3C Server Timing specification^] that enables servers to communicate performance metrics about the request-response cycle to the client.
These metrics can include:

* Total request processing time
* Database query durations
* Controller action execution time
* View rendering time
* Any custom metrics you want to track

=== Why Use This Plugin?

When developing and debugging Grails applications, understanding where time is spent during request processing is crucial.
This plugin automatically captures:

* **Action Timing** - How long your controller action takes to execute
* **View Timing** - How long GSP/view rendering takes
* **Total Timing** - The complete request lifecycle
* **Other Timing** - Time spent on non-controller requests (static assets, etc.)

All of this information is exposed via the standard `Server-Timing` header, which modern browsers display in their Network developer tools panel.

=== Browser Support

The Server-Timing header is supported by all modern browsers:

* Chrome 65+
* Firefox 61+
* Edge 79+
* Safari 16.4+
* Opera 52+

=== Quick Start

Add the plugin dependency to your `build.gradle`:

[source,groovy,subs="attributes"]
----
dependencies {
    implementation 'org.grails.plugins:grails-server-timing:{version}'
}
----

That's it!
The plugin is automatically enabled in `development` and `test` environments only.
No additional configuration is required to get started.

NOTE: For security reasons, the plugin is **disabled by default in production**.
Server-Timing headers can expose timing information that may be useful to attackers.
See the <<Server-Timing Specification>> and <<Configuration>> sections for more details.
